DB to file => instead of direct access to the Map
    + => make map private
    + => create public getter
    + => getter will read file, Gson-it and return Map
    + => for set and delete create a method persist() or set, that will GSON the Map back to string
            and save it to file
Implement the ability to read a request from a file.
     If the -in argument followed by the file name was provided, you should read a request
     from that file. The file will be stored in /client/data.

     + => if arg filePath (-in) is not null then read file @ path and send as request

Create a multithreaded server =>
    - => let main thread handle incoming requests and dispatch service of those requests to separate
             threads using ExecutorService
    - => use ReentrantReadWrite for parallel reads and exclusive writes
    - => figure out where to lock -> Repo ? DB ?
