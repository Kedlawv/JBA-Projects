Stage 1/6: 100-cell database
Description
JSON database is a single file database that stores information in the form of JSON. It is a remote database, so it's usually accessed through the Internet.

In this stage, you need to simulate a database that can store text information in an array of the size 100. From the start of the database, every cell contains an empty string. Users can save strings in the cells, read the information from these cells, and delete that information if needed. After a string has been deleted, that cell should contain an empty string.

The user can use the set, get, or, delete commands.

After set, the user should specify a number (1-100) and the text to be saved in the cell. If the index is wrong, the program should output ERROR, otherwise, output OK. If the specified cell already contains information, it should be overwritten.

After get, the user should specify the number of the cell from which they want to get information. If the cell is empty or the index is wrong, the program should output ERROR; otherwise, the program should output the content of the cell.

After delete, the user should specify the number of the cell. If the index is wrong, the program should output ERROR; otherwise, output OK. If the string is empty, you don't have to do anything.

To exit the program, the user should enter exit.
